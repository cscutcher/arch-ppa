# Chris Scutcher's Arch PPA

This repo contains the source for my personal package repo I use for my arch
deploys.

It's based (and forked from) the [excellent tool][orig_repo] written by
[EnigmaCurry].

My main copy of this repo lives on [GitLab] but I maintain a [GitHub mirror]
as that's where the upstream repo resides.

For more information on the arch-ppa tool see
[the original README.md][arch-ppa readme].

### Changes from upstream
Apart from adding packages in src I've also made some minor modifications to
the `arch-ppa` script and added a makefile for my conveniance.
